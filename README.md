# What is Minimap2?
Minimap2 is an open-source program that maps DNA/mRNA sequences against a reference database (usually large). It's a general-purpose alignment program that is used in the field of bioinformatics and it's runtime is heavily machine-dependent.
# Custom DNA/mRNA Sequence Mapper
The script `run_minimap.pl` allows biologists to run open-source sequence alignment program Minimap2 via the command-line. The user must only pass in reference files and the amount of CPU threads they wish to use for the program to work. Mapping FASTQ data against FASTA is a computationally heavy process, thus leveraging programs such as Minimap2 in optimal ways (taking advantage of machine resources, i.e. cores) is essential for faster runtime. Without `run_minimap.pl`, the user would have to iterate through every file manually, which is an intensive task. The Perl script has been detailed with comments to help the user run it properly.
